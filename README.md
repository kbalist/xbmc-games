First of all thanks to : 

* [XBMC](http://xbmc.org)
* [Advanced Launcher](http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-advanced-launcher/)

This fileset prepare all the work to transform your XBMC Live into a perfect console emulator.

Usage:
------

Before installing this fileset, you need an operating XBMC installation (I use XBMC live),and the plugin "[Advanced Launcher](http://www.gwenael.org/xbmc/index.php?title=Main_Page)"

Based on "AdvancedLauncher", it will help you in setupping [Advanced Launcher](http://www.gwenael.org/xbmc/index.php?title=Main_Page)
in a more practical way than the gui (as you already have to do to install the required emulators)

- install advanced launcher
- install emulators :
- install configuration : advancedLaunchers.xml
- 

`sudo apt-get install zsnes fceux mupen64plus`
