Usage:
------

This fileset prepare all the work to transform your XBMC Live into a perfect console emulator.

Before installing this fileset, you need an operating XBMC installation (I use XBMC live),and the plugin "[Advanced Launcher](http://www.gwenael.org/xbmc/index.php?title=Main_Page)"

Based on "AdvancedLauncher", it will help you in setupping [Advanced Launcher](http://www.gwenael.org/xbmc/index.php?title=Main_Page)
in a more practical way than the gui (as you already have to do to install the required emulators)

- install advanced launcher (from what i know, the only way is to install it via a zip file)
- install emulators (we will configure them after)
  `sudo apt-get install dolphin-emu  mupen64plus fceux gfceux pcsx pcsx2 zsnes`
- install configuration or link to it (works fine) : advancedLaunchers.xml
- L
